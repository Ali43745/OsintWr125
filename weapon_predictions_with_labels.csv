The SARO ""Lerwick"" (Model A.36) was perhaps one of its more forgettable designs in that design flaws and tricky handling severely hampered its service record, leading to just twenty-one of the aircraft being delivered. Its accident rate proved so high that the type was retired as soon as 1942 though the series was only in service since mid-1939. First flight of a prototype was in November of 1938 and operators were limited to the British Royal Air Force (RAF) while Canadians also trained on the type.",(24.63 m),(6.10 m),Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,image_1259.jpg,Saunders-Roe A.36 Lerwick Bomber_Aircraft United Kingdom Reconnaissance Flying Boat Aircraft,12,

This spurred the United States Army Air Corps (USAAC) to seek out a new all-modern, long-range heavy bomber with capabilities to fly outside of the reach of enemy air defenses (including interceptors) and far into enemy-held territory. Douglas aircraft was one of the firms to respond to the requirement and delivered their Model 423 as a result.

Its wing arrangement was largely unconventional and included forward canards near amidships with the main wing assemblies at the rear of the airframe. Control was through a variety of facilities including Fly-By-Wire (FBW), specialized correcting software, canards positioning and thrust-vectoring at the engine exhaust port. As a tailless aircraft, it lacked any vertical tail surfaces. The single engine installation was aspirated by a pair of intakes at the front of the layout, one fitted to either side of the fuselage near the cockpit. As a remotely-piloted design, the X-36 also lacked a ""true"" cockpit as the operator piloted the aircraft from a Ground Control Station (GCS). Since the cockpit did not require space and facilities to support a human pilot, the entire aircraft was designed at 28 percent scale to control costs, speed up development and provide better access to key internal components. The X-36 was, therefore, only representative of a possible future fighter design.",(3.15 m),(0.95 m),Unknown,0 (UNMANNED),"5,000 m | 3 miles",image_3950.jpg,Boeing (McDonnell Douglas) X-36 Drones United States Unmanned Fighter Technology Demonstrator,16,

MH-6 models were used to shuttle Delta Force operatives into action during the operation. AH-6 gunship counterparts provided fire support to both Delta Force and Army Ranger elements attempting to reach one of the Blackhawk crash sites. In the ensuing action, the crew of a MH-6 succeeded in rescuing two injured US service personnel by landing near one of the crash sites - one crewmember left the aircraft on foot with the other supplied suppressive fire with his automatic weapon from the cockpit of the awaiting helicopter. Though the Battle of Mogadishu brought about a rather dark moment in the history of the American military, one cannot gloss over the level of sheer self-sacrifice that drove all personnel involved in the operation to do what they did for one another. Little Birds worked tirelessly throughout the night to keep Mohammad Farrah Aidid's cronies at bay. On a related note here is that several AH-6 Little Bird models returned to Somalia in September of 2009 and successfully killed terrorist Saleh Ali Saleh Nabhan.",2 (MANNED),"11,000 m | 7 miles",image_3904.jpg,UMS V-150_v2 Drones Switzerland Rotary-Wing Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS),16,

Its accident rate proved so high that the type was retired as soon as 1942 though the series was only in service since mid-1939.

This spurred the United States Army Air Corps (USAAC) to seek out a new all-modern, long-range heavy bomber with capabilities to fly outside of the reach of enemy air defenses (including interceptors) and far into enemy-held territory. Douglas aircraft was one of the firms to respond to the requirement and delivered their Model 423 as a result.

Its wing arrangement was largely unconventional and included forward canards near amidships with the main wing assemblies at the rear of the airframe. Control was through a variety of facilities including Fly-By-Wire (FBW), specialized correcting software, canards positioning and thrust-vectoring at the engine exhaust port. As a tailless aircraft, it lacked any vertical tail surfaces. The single engine installation was aspirated by a pair of intakes at the front of the layout, one fitted to either side of the fuselage near the cockpit. As a remotely-piloted design, the X-36 also lacked a ""true"" cockpit as the operator piloted the aircraft from a Ground Control Station (GCS). Since the cockpit did not require space and facilities to support a human pilot, the entire aircraft was designed at 28 percent scale to control costs, speed up development and provide better access to key internal components. The X-36 was, therefore, only representative of a possible future fighter design.",(3.15 m),(0.95 m),Unknown,0 (UNMANNED),"5,000 m | 3 miles",image_3950.jpg,Boeing (McDonnell Douglas) X-36 Drones United States Unmanned Fighter Technology Demonstrator,16,

MH-6 models were used to shuttle Delta Force operatives into action during the operation. AH-6 gunship counterparts provided fire support to both Delta Force and Army Ranger elements attempting to reach one of the Blackhawk crash sites. In the ensuing action, the crew of a MH-6 succeeded in rescuing two injured US service personnel by landing near one of the crash sites - one crewmember left the aircraft on foot with the other supplied suppressive fire with his automatic weapon from the cockpit of the awaiting helicopter. Though the Battle of Mogadishu brought about a rather dark moment in the history of the American military, one cannot gloss over the level of sheer self-sacrifice that drove all personnel involved in the operation to do what they did for one another. Little Birds worked tirelessly throughout the night to keep Mohammad Farrah Aidid's cronies at bay. On a related note here is that several AH-6 Little Bird models returned to Somalia in September of 2009 and successfully killed terrorist Saleh Ali Saleh Nabhan.
